# **Review of *Ender’s Game* by Orson Scott Card**

I'm always trying to get anyone who'll listen to read more. It's a privilege that never should be taken for granted. I figured I'd talk about one of my favorite books. 

Orson Scott Card’s *Ender’s Game* delivers a story that resonates on many levels, especially through the struggles of its young protagonist, Ender Wiggin. I remember discovering this series skipping school sitting in the SciFi section at the library. From enduring bullying to grappling with the weight of impossible expectations, Ender’s difficult childhood reminded me of my own battles for acceptance and self-worth. 

His journey mirrors the emotional complexity of being shaped by external forces while yearning to stay true to one’s inner humanity—a tension that defines much of what makes the novel so compelling.

## **Introduction to *Ender's Game***

*Ender’s Game*, first published in 1985, is a science fiction novel that has become a cornerstone of the genre, celebrated for its compelling exploration of morality, identity, and survival. Set in a future where humanity is locked in a deadly struggle with an alien race known as the Formics, the novel follows Andrew “Ender” Wiggin, a child prodigy recruited to lead humanity’s war effort. Through the lens of Ender’s experiences, Card examines the weight of responsibility, the nature of empathy, and the paradox of wielding violence to achieve peace.

The story’s emotional depth is amplified by its richly drawn characters, each grappling with internal and external conflicts that challenge their humanity. What makes *Ender’s Game* truly memorable, however, is its ability to make even its most villainous characters relatable, weaving their flaws and motivations into a larger narrative about the complexities of human existence.

## **Ender Wiggin: The Prodigy with a Heavy Burden**

Ender Wiggin’s journey is both harrowing and profoundly human. Selected at the age of six for his unparalleled intelligence and strategic mind, he is thrust into a world that demands constant sacrifice. His brilliance isolates him from his peers, as does his designation as a “Third,” a third-born child in a society that stigmatizes families with more than two children. From the outset, Ender’s life is shaped by forces beyond his control.

Ender’s pain is tragically relatable. Despite his intelligence, he longs for connection, struggling against the fear that his capacity for violence will make him like his ruthless older brother, Peter. This fear manifests in his interactions with bullies, such as Stilson and Bonzo Madrid, whom he defeats not out of malice but out of necessity. Each victory leaves Ender more alienated, trapped by the realization that survival often requires destroying others—a lesson that fills him with guilt and sorrow.

Yet, Ender’s empathy is his greatest strength. Even as he rises through the ranks at Battle School, his strategies reflect a desire to protect his teammates rather than dominate them. His brilliance in commanding simulations showcases his tactical genius, but it is his ability to inspire loyalty and camaraderie that makes him truly remarkable. His internal conflict—between the warrior he must become and the compassionate boy he wishes to remain—is the beating heart of the novel.

## **The Wiggin Siblings: Peter, Valentine, and the Complexity of Family**

The Wiggin siblings represent three facets of human nature: Peter as the embodiment of ambition and cruelty, Valentine as a beacon of empathy and love, and Ender as the fragile balance between the two. Each sibling is shaped by the pressures of their environment, resulting in choices that are both admirable and troubling.

- **Peter Wiggin**: Peter’s cruelty is chilling, yet Card paints him as more than a one-dimensional villain. His desire for control stems from a deep-seated insecurity and a desperate need to prove his worth. As he manipulates global politics under the alias of Locke, Peter reveals a cunning mind capable of immense influence. While his methods are ruthless, his motivations—a mix of ambition and a twisted sense of responsibility—make him a tragic figure.

- **Valentine Wiggin**: In contrast, Valentine provides Ender with the emotional anchor he so desperately needs. Her deep empathy allows her to see through Peter’s schemes and Ender’s struggles, but it also makes her vulnerable to manipulation. Valentine’s decision to help Ender, despite her reservations about the morality of his mission, highlights the complex interplay between love and complicity.

Together, the Wiggin siblings offer a nuanced exploration of familial bonds and the ways in which shared experiences can both unite and divide.

## **Graff and Anderson: The Ethics of Manipulation**

Colonel Graff and Major Anderson serve as the architects of Ender’s journey, manipulating him and his environment to prepare him for the ultimate battle. Their actions raise profound ethical questions: Is it justified to sacrifice the innocence of a child for the survival of humanity?

- **Colonel Graff**: Graff’s treatment of Ender is often harsh, isolating him to foster independence and pushing him to his physical and emotional limits. Yet, Graff’s internal conflict is palpable. He recognizes the moral cost of his actions, even as he rationalizes them as necessary. His eventual admission of guilt underscores the novel’s exploration of leadership and the heavy toll it exacts.

- **Major Anderson**: Anderson’s role is less visible but equally critical. Tasked with designing the simulations that test Ender’s abilities, Anderson becomes a silent witness to the psychological toll these challenges inflict. His occasional objections to Graff’s methods reveal a man torn between duty and morality.

Both characters reflect the broader theme of moral ambiguity in leadership, forcing readers to consider the cost of survival when the stakes are existential.

## **The Alien Enemy: Empathizing with the Formics**

One of the most poignant aspects of *Ender’s Game* is its eventual revelation of the Formics’ true nature. Initially presented as a faceless enemy, the Formics are later shown to possess a complex, hive-like intelligence capable of empathy and remorse. Their attack on humanity, driven by a misunderstanding, becomes a tragic backdrop for the war.

Ender’s realization of the Formics’ sentience is devastating. He learns that the very traits that make him a brilliant strategist—his ability to understand and predict the enemy’s actions—also make him uniquely equipped to empathize with them. This duality underscores the novel’s central irony: Ender is both humanity’s savior and the unwitting perpetrator of genocide. His anguish over this revelation is a powerful reminder of the consequences of dehumanizing the “other.”

### **Moral Ambiguity in Leadership**

The novel grapples with the ethical dilemmas faced by leaders in times of crisis. Through characters like Graff and Ender, Card explores the tension between achieving necessary goals and preserving one’s humanity. This theme is particularly relevant in today’s world, where leaders must often make difficult decisions with far-reaching consequences.

### **The Cost of War**

At its core, *Ender’s Game* is a meditation on the devastating impact of war. The physical and emotional scars borne by its characters serve as a stark reminder of the sacrifices demanded by conflict. Ender’s eventual exile reflects the novel’s critique of a society that prioritizes survival over individual well-being.

## **Emotional Turmoil and The Resulting Growth**

Each character in *Ender’s Game* undergoes a transformative journey, shaped by the challenges they face. From Ender’s internal struggle with violence to Valentine’s conflicted loyalty, the novel presents a tapestry of human emotions that resonate until it hurts.

- **Ender’s Guilt**: Ender’s turmoil reaches its peak when he learns the truth about the final simulation, discovering that he has unknowingly committed genocide. His grief and self-imposed exile are a testament to his enduring humanity, even in the face of unimaginable guilt.

- **Valentine’s Dilemma**: Valentine’s love for Ender is tested by her role in supporting his mission. Her willingness to compromise her values for his sake adds a layer of complexity to her character, highlighting the sacrifices demanded by love.
